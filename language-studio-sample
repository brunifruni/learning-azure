From the moment I arrived, things went wrong. The front desk staff seemed uninterested and made me wait over 20 minutes just to check in, even though there was no line.\n\nThe room was not clean — I found hair on the sheets and dust on the furniture. The bathroom smelled like mold, and the shower had very low water pressure. I asked to change rooms, but the hotel was supposedly \\"fully booked.\\"\n\nTo make things worse, the Wi-Fi didn’t work at all during my stay, and no one from the staff could fix it. I also ordered room service, but it took over an hour to arrive and the food was cold and tasteless.\n\nThe worst part was the noise — loud music from nearby bars kept me awake until 3 a.m. every night, and the hotel had no soundproofing whatsoever.\n\nI honestly regret staying here. It was far from the relaxing experience I was hoping for. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.\",\"language\":\"en\"}]},\"parameters\":{\"opinionMining\":true}}"
